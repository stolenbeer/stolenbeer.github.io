A few months ago I was chatting with my father-in-law who had just come back from meeting up with friends at our local brewery. One of their party was drinking a Berliner Weisse that had been aged for a year and was claiming that it was a healthy probiotic beer. At the time I scoffed at the idea, as surely the lactobacillus would not be alive in the end result. But it got me thinking - is it possible to brew a probiotic beer that is good for you?

Yeast consumes sugars to produce alcohol and CO2 (and then drops out of suspension after fermentation is complete). We may incidentally consume a tiny bit of yeast but what we drink beer for is the **byproduct** of yeast, alcohol, not yeast itself. This is the same for *lactobacillus* which consumes glucose, fructose and maltose and produces lactic acid which sours the wort. This is not to say that lacto cannot survive into the final product, just that beer is not as simple as what goes in must come out.
