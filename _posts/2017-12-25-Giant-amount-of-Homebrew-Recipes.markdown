Some recipes I'm keen to try in the future:

### Dark beers ###
- I love a good stout and [this oatmeal stout](https://www.homebrewersassociation.org/homebrew-recipe/danado-de-bom-oatmeal-stout-damn-good-oatmeal-stout/) caught my eye. It seems to be heavier on the chocolate and roasted malt than [my previous oatmeal stout](/stouts/2017/05/09/010-Oatmeat-Stout)

### Sours ###
- I'm partial to a good sour, and would like to venture into giving a Flanders Red Ale a go. A recipe that looks good is [Jamil's Flanders Red](https://www.homebrewersassociation.org/homebrew-recipe/jamils-flanders-red/) which won gold in the Sour Ales category at the 2007 *National Homebrew Competition*. It looks like [Zed's Dead Red](https://www.brewersfriend.com/homebrew/recipe/view/346508/zed-s-dead-red), which took out gold in 2010, is the exact same recipe.
- Or perhaps a Berliner Weisse might be in order. [If You Like Pi√±a Coladas](https://www.fivebladesbrewing.com/homebrew-recipes/nhc-2016/like-pina-coladas/) features a **HUGE** addition (think 50% of fermentables) of Pineapple and Coconut.

### IPAs ###
- Who could resist brewing Satan's IPA? At 6.66% ABV, and having both a tonne of hops and a bit of malt character, Jamil's [Evil Twin](https://www.homebrewersassociation.org/homebrew-recipe/evil-twin/) looks like a winner.
- I've never had a Pliny the Elder before, and given where I live doubt i'll ever have the chance. Perhaps I'll just have to put down a [Pliny the Elder clone](https://www.homebrewersassociation.org/homebrew-recipe/russian-river-pliny-the-elder-clone/) instead.
- Simcoe, Mosaic and Amarillo look like a winning combination in this clone of *Tiered Hands'* hazy, oat IPA dubbed ["Pineal"](http://www.craftedpours.com/homebrew-recipe/tired-hands-pineal-ipa-clone-homebrew-recipe)
- My last [Rye IPA](https://stolenbeer.github.io/ipas/2017/03/31/008-Session-IPA.html) was a bit of a dud. Next time I brew in that style I think I'll give an [Alpine Nelson Clone](http://www.craftedpours.com/homebrew-recipe/alpine-nelson-clone-homebrew-recipe) a try.
- On the theme of New Zealand hops, *Zipline Brewing Co's* [NZ IPA](https://www.homebrewersassociation.org/homebrew-recipe/zipline-brewing-co-nz-ipa/) and *The Pour Report's* [single tap IPA recipe](http://www.thepourreport.com/single-tap-ipa-recipe/) featuring Nelson Sauvin don't look half bad...
