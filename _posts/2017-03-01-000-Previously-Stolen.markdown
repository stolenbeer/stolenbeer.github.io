My lovely wife, Phoebe, bought me a [brewsmith]('https://brewsmith.com.au/') kit for my birthday in late 2016. After making a couple kit recipes, and another couple partial mash extract beers, I switched to doing all grain BIAB beers. Here are my first half dozen+ all grain batches which turned out with varying success.

## No.001 - Coffee Stout

This turned out pretty great for my first all grain batch. In future batches I think using whole beans will be the easiest way of adding coffee to the fermenter in the future.

## No.002 - Pacific Ale

## No.005 - Dandelion Session Pale Ale

This was decent for the first beer that I designed. I harvested dandelion from my garden and used the whole plant in this beer. The leaves were used for bittering, I roasted up the roots to add to the mash, and threw in dandelion flowers at flameout. Fun, but a bit of extra work cleaning up the dandelion and preparing it for use.

## No.006 - Zombie Dust Clone

## No.007 - Nelson Galaxy Pale Ale

This was a dumper and I dub it a _Fail Ale_. I brewed this one of the hottest days of the year and failed to regulate temperature swing. The yeast stressed out and the resulting beer tasted pretty harsh. After this batch I invested in a temperature controller and fridge and since my beers have significantly improved.
